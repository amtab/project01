<h1> Ayana's First Project </h1>
<p>  The most challenging aspect of my project was trying to figure out how to align and re-size my images. It took me multiple tries to figure out how to make them align using the skeleton grid. I also had a very hard time change their height and width in CSS. The most interesting thing that I found about this project was learning how to use transformation and transitions in CSS. I applied them not only to my images but to my navigation as well. I think by doing this it gave a very interesting look and feel to the nav bar. Some techniques I learned from this project were implementing the skeleton grid in a way that fit my page. Although it was difficult for me, I think I was able to  use it in a manner that worked well for my page. I used websites such as http://www.w3schools.com/ that helped me with colors, headers, and transitions. I also used the http://css3generator.com/ for transitions and decorations for my images. I tried many things out for my project that I had to delete or change because they were not working. One of them being the background color my .main container. Whatever I tried it ended up not working out or not aligning properly so I had to completely get rid of it. This was disappointing because I think it detracted from the ascetics of my page. I also had to delete many of my headings. Even when I changed the text size of one of my h2 or h4â€™s I was never able to get it the way I wanted it to look. I found that I just had to use one of the smallest heading possible. I also tried to use certain transitions and transformations, such as a fade in and out, for my images and I had to delete those too. I would improve my project by adding more transformations to my images. I think I was able to do it correctly, but next time I would like to add other elements to it. Another thing I would add is a logo and more images to the index page. It looks kind of blank as of now.</p>
